# Override classification for *.txt files, so they are highlighted as adblock files.
# - This example will match all *.txt files in the repository, but you can
#   customize path(s) to match only specific files, such as /filters/*.txt
#   or /filters/*.adblock. See https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes for more details.
# - By default, Adblock language doesn't show up in the repository's language statistics,
#   but adding linguist-detectable will resolve this, so it is recommended to add it.
